<p align="center">Credible was extracted from <a href="https://github.com/thombruce/helvellyn">thombruce/helvellyn</a> and is still a work in progress. The goal is to provide JWT and API token based authentication using <a href="https://github.com/wardencommunity/warden/">Warden</a> for Rails API applications.</p>

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'credible'
```

And then execute:
```bash
$ bundle
```

Mount Credible's authentication routes in your `config/routes.rb` file:

```ruby
Rails.application.routes.draw do
  mount Credible::Engine => "/auth"
end
```

And in your Application Controller, inherit from `Credible::ControllerConcern`:

```ruby
class ApplicationController < ActionController::Base
  include Credible::ControllerConcern
end
```

Credible is a work in progress and requires a complicated setup for now. It was extracted from [thombruce/helvellyn](https://github.com/thombruce/helvellyn). You'll need to add models and configure them manually. In future, I'll had helpers to handle this for you.

## Add Models

To get Credible working, your app will need at least a User model and a Session model.

### User model

```bash
rails g model User email:string:uniq password_digest:string confirmation_token:token confirmed_at:datetime
```

```ruby
class User < ApplicationRecord
  include Credible::User
end
```

### Session model

```bash
rails g model Session user:references token:token
```

```ruby
class Session < ApplicationRecord
  include Credible::Session
end
```

##Â Calling the API

To sign up and create a new user, send params in the form `{ user: { email: 'email@example.com', password: 'Pa$$word123!' } }` to `auth/signup` as a `POST` request. On success, this will return `{ access_token: '...', refresh_token: '...' }` that can be used to persist the user's session.

To sign in a user, send params in the form `{ session: { login: 'email@example.com', password: 'Pa$$word123!' } }` to `auth/login` as a `POST` request. On success, this will return `{ access_token: '...', refresh_token: '...' }` that can be used to persist the user's session.

To sign out a user, send an empty request to `auth/signout` as a `DELETE` request. On success, this will return no content. It will destroy the session in the database and invalidate any existing tokens. Note: If you are using the access token to authenticate the user on a separate server, it will still remain valid until its expiry.

To refresh an access token, send params in the form `{ refresh_token: '...' }` to `auth/refresh` as a `POST` request. On success, this will return `{ access_token: '...', refresh_token: '...' }` that can be used to continue the user's session. Note: This will also invalidate the refresh token used to renew the tokens, and provide a new refresh token for next use.

> **Be careful**
>
> Credible is still a work in progress and these routes will be subject to change. I'm thinking about keeping them around as sort of a "classic" mode, but I feel like more resource-oriented routes are also desirable. For example, I want to add a `/tokens` endpoint in place of the existing `/refresh` enpoint, because _refresh what?_ It's just more semantically correct.

## Mailers

To user Credible's in-built mailers, you must set a hostname for your application. A suitable setting for this in `config/environments/development.rb` might be:

```ruby
config.action_mailer.default_url_options = { host: 'localhost', port: 3000 }
```

Your app will also be expected to accept and properly route requests for `[root URL]/confirm/[confirmation token]?email=[email]`. The `confirmation_token` and `email` params should be sent with an AJAX request to the Credible auth route.

For example, if you have Credible mounted as `mount Credible::Engine => "/auth"`, you would make a get request to `/auth/confirm/[confirmation token]?email=[email]`.

_This is a little complicated and not very user friendly. A future version will provide an engine_name to assist with Rails' URL helpers, as well as an in-built UI for handling these requests on your behalf._
